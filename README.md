# Google Web Clone
A web clone of google.com was created to practice my HTML and CSS skills. This is only for educational purposes. Here, pure HTML and CSS were used without frameworks, and CSS flex layouts were used. The search tab is linked with a programmable search engine by google therefore, anything can be searched as in the original web page. Also, gmail can be accessed through this web clone. <br>
